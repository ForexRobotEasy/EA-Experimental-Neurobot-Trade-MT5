# EA Experimental Neurobot Trade MT5

This code is an implementation of the EA (Expert Advisor) Experimental Neurobot Trade for MetaTrader 5 (MT5). It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found on their website [Forex Robot Easy](https://www.forexroboteasy.com).

## Functionality

The EA Experimental Neurobot Trade MT5 is designed to perform automated trading in the forex market using a unique algorithm. It analyzes market data and makes trading decisions based on the comparison of the current price with the previous price.

The EA uses the `OnInit()` function to set initial parameters, such as the initial deposit, minimum deposit requirement, and lot size. It checks if the initial deposit meets the minimum requirement and terminates the EA if it does not.

The `OnTick()` function is triggered whenever there is a new tick in the market. It performs market analysis by comparing the current price with the previous price. If the current price is higher than the previous price, a buy trade is executed. If the current price is lower than the previous price, a sell trade is executed. If there is no significant price movement, no trading decision is made.

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is being deinitialized. It performs necessary cleanup tasks and prints a message indicating the reason for deinitialization.

The `OnOptimization()` function is used for parameter optimization. It can be customized to optimize the parameters of the algorithm used in the EA.
